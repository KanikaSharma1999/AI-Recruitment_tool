# 📝 Job Resume Ranker & Feedback System

An intelligent NLP-powered web app that ranks resumes based on how well they match a given job description — and gives constructive feedback on the best one. Built with **Streamlit**, **sentence-transformers**, and **Cohere's LLM**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📥 Upload a **job description** (`.txt`)  and multiple **resumes** (`.pdf` or `.txt`)
- 📊 Ranks resumes by **semantic similarity**
- 🤖 Generates **personalized feedback** for the top resume using **Cohere's LLM**
- ⚡ Built with **modern NLP**: sentence embeddings + cosine similarity
- 🌐 Simple, interactive web interface with **Streamlit**

---

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. Data Upload & Preprocessing
- Users upload a **job description** and **resumes**
- Text is extracted and cleaned (via regex + PyPDF2)

### 2. Semantic Ranking
- Uses `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` from `sentence-transformers` to embed text
- Computes **cosine similarity** between each resume and the job description
- Resumes are sorted based on similarity score

### 3. Feedback Generation
- The top-matching resume is sent to **Cohere's `command-r-plus` API**
- It returns a **constructive, job-specific review** with suggestions
